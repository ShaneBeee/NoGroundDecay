# NoGroundDecay

![](https://i.imgur.com/n9CMEru.png)

This plugin was designed to help with issues of other plugins placing leaves on the ground, and then decaying if you remove the plugin (Such as world generator plugins)
Also this helps with things like WorldPainter painting leaves on the ground, but decaying when you run your server.
